This board  supports two power rails, an Arduino nano and 
3 Molex kk connectors to fit the power input, an Itead Nextion touche display, and
an "all in one" RF detector designed by SV1AFN including : 
An AD8318 det.log, a 12 bits ADC and a low noise 5V power supply. All details at

This is a one day project, even for unexperimented ham/hackers. 

Board's dimension is 5x10 cm. 
Two boards could be panelized to fit in a 10x10 standard pcb format
